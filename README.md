# Vehicle-Builder

## Description
This is a vehicle builder where you can develop three different types of vehicles: cars, trucks, and motorbikes. You can add details such as color, make and model, year, and weight.
All vehicles have the option to accelerate and decelerate by 5 mph, trucks have the ability to tow other vehicles, and motorbikes have the ability to do a wheelie.
